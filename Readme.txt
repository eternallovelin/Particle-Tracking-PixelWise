Title: Red Object Tracking 
Description: This code is modified from the demo of red object tracking in Matlab
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33666-simple-particle-filter-demo)
with some other features.  
  1. The object is first selected to track. 
  2. Particles are generated inside the bounding box with gaussian distribution
     instead of random generated entire frame. 

Usage: 
  1. Press 'p' to pause video 
  2. Using cursors to draw the bounding box of object wish to be tracked.
